Administrators Portal Welcome page with Main Menu

## Here administrators can choose to:

**Generage Reports** - Under Hours, reports to send home to parents via email or paper printed (would like to move away from paper printed reports), [CRUD - Read Database]

**Edit Student & User Information** - Edit student information, Edit volunteer Information, Add hours, Remove hours,  - [CRUD - Create, Update, Read]

**Get Support** - Give contact information to the assistant principal, Jen Rimes, Me, and anyone else who might need assistance.  There will be a form they can submit that will email the correct person with their issue.  Or they can just call the numbers listed on the site.  Might put a map and directions to school for those who may not have that info.
