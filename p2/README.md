## Notes for instructor
This application will calculate the total number of volunteer hours recorded as well as the number of hours remaining based on the data in the `**jan2020.json**` and `**feb2020.json**` files.  For now the application only calculates the amount of time completed on the month you select in the drop down field.

Each student must have 36 hours of volunteer time completed by a parent, family memeber, guardian, friend of the family, etc. by the end of the year.  Here is a list of the student names in the json files:
+ Julie Jones
+ John Jones
+ Porsha Key
+ Audrey Hamilton
+ Jack Turner

The user can choose to view a detailed report or not.  The detailed report displays a table of all of the volunteers, the date they volunteered, and the number of minutes they volunteered that day.  Then below that table will be an overview that displays the student's name, hours completed, and hours remaining.  

If the user chooses to not view the detailed report they will get the overview with just the student's name, hours completed, and hours remaining.  

The report will appear at the bottom of the screen below the form.

If the user doesn't fill out the form completely then the errors will appear below the process button at the bottom of the form.
